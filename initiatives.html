        <p>One of our biggest initiatives is disability accomodation. Through fundraisaing and networking efforts
        we source wheelchairs for schools. Additionally, we contruct wheelchair ramps and sitting toilets.
        Students in Tanzania are restricted from recieving a proper education, for disabilities that could
        easily be accomodated with more resources.</p>
