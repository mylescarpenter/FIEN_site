        <h2>Meet our founder</h2>
        <p>Magessa George earned his Bachelor of Education in Languages and Management from Mzumbe University in Tanzania, where
           he developed a strong foundation in both teaching and Management skills. He further advanced his academic journey by
            obtaining a Master of Science in Human Resource Management from the same institution, which enhanced his expertise in
             managing human resources effectively.
          <br><br>
In addition to his formal education, George pursued leadership training at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the United States, where he honed his leadership abilities and gained invaluable insights into effective organizational management.
<br><br>
George began his professional career as a teacher in public schools in Morogoro Municipality in Tanzania, where he worked tirelessly to inspire and educate young minds. His passion for improving education and addressing the needs of underprivileged students led him to establish the Foundation for Improving Educational Outcomes for Needy Students (FIEN Foundation) in 2019. The foundation was born out of his desire to create lasting change in the education system and provide support to students who face barriers to succeed in their education. 
<br><br>
In 2023, driven by his commitment to the mission of FIEN Foundation, George transitioned to a full-time role as the CEO, where he now leads the organization with dedication and vision, working to enhance educational opportunities to  students across Tanzania.</p>
